To run the program:
1. make main
2. cd dist
3. ./main ../inputFiles/wordsForBigDict.txt ../inputFiles/BigDict.txt
(you will see how 'last' is transformed to 'face' using a dictionary of 999 words) 

To run the tests:
1. make tests
2. cd dist
3. ./tests

Run 'make' without parameters for both main and tests targets.
